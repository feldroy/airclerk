# airclerk

Air + Clerk for user management.

## Environment Variables

AirClerk is driven by the following environment variables:

| Variable | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | str | Yes | - | Clerk publishable API key for client-side authentication |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | str | Yes | - | Clerk secret API key for server-side operations |
| `CLERK_JS_SRC` | str | No | `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@clerk/clerk-js@5/dist/clerk.browser.js` | CDN URL for the Clerk JavaScript library |
| `CLERK_LOGIN_ROUTE` | str | No | `/login` | URL path for the login page |
| `CLERK_LOGOUT_ROUTE` | str | No | `/logout` | URL path for the logout endpoint |
| `CLERK_LOGIN_REDIRECT_ROUTE` | str | No | `/` | Where the user is redirected to after login |
| `CLERK_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_ROUTE` | str | No | `/` | Where the user is redirected to after logout |

You must set the required environment variables for AirClerk to function properly. Optional variables can be customized as needed.

## Usage

To use AirClerk in your Air application, include the middleware and router as shown below:

```python
import air
import airclerk

app = air.Air()
app.add_middleware(air.SessionMiddleware, secret_key="change-me")
app.include_router(airclerk.router)
```

Use the verified session claims for most routes:

```python
@app.page
def protected(claims=airclerk.require_auth_claims):
    return air.P(f"Signed in as {claims['sub']}")
```

Use `airclerk.require_user` when a route needs the full Clerk profile. The
existing `airclerk.require_auth` dependency remains an alias for that
full-profile behavior. `airclerk.fetch_user(user_id)` is available for
explicit lookups.

When you run a development OAuth-powered Air application with AirClerk, don't use localhost as your domain, as Clerk does not support it. Use `127.0.0.1` instead.
